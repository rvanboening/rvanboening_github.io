title:  "Day 6 Snow Day"
---

Today was a snowday, for which I am thankful for. The roads were gross and I'm a big fan of working from my bed. it's funny, I would say most people find it difficult to work from there bed. But, all throughout my educuation I've studied with book, notes, and my computer spread out over my bed. It works great for me. I don't want to get up, I'm confortbale, and I have fewer distraction in my room than other places in my house. I also find my room very peaceful and comforting. 

I did miss seeing my everyong today, however it I thought slack and github worked great for communicating. I do however have a hard time working with the professers through slack, I find formal person to person instruction more benifical. 

I don't think I could work remotely all of the time because I am such a socail person however maybe a couple times a week.
