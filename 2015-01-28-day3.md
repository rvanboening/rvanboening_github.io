title:  "Day 3 was Rough”
---

I am writing to you the morning after day 3. It was rough. My advice is do the pre work like it is your job. Except I had a job, well 2 jobs. The prep work was hard and intimidating, scary and frustrating. But nothing like not knowing what everyone else does on day 3. 

Let's keep this upbeat. Day 3 we reviewed our homework assignment, the check splitter. Which I don’t have it done nor do I understand fully. I know it will click I just have to keep working at it. 
Arrays and Hashes can all talk. I’m gonna figure that out. 
It’s best to write code that is simple and can be changed easily. So break everything down and make it easy because you will constantly be changing it. 
We are working with object oriented coding. Which means that everything is an object. Objects have methods and patterns and when told to they will interact with each other. 

We were introduced to testing our code. It seemed so practical, which I like. I need to work on that a little more. 

I also want to touch on something Andrew mentioned. Integration tests. How I understand it is the way people navigate through a website, or how they use an application. THIS IS WHAT I LOVE. I mean I think. Just hearing that yesterday really gave me hope. I am in the right place, I do know this is for me. And I will learn how to be a programmer. 

Peace and Love, 
Rachel
