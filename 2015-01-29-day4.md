title:  "Day 4 Clicked”
---

Oh My Gosh. It clicked today. After a little code review with the professor I got it. Coding isn't actually just memorizing code. Code is operated under a set of rules and ideas. But you can change any of them. I do remember talking about that the first day but I didn't understand until today. 

Let me just run through the important stuff that I learned. A class is a blueprint or a factory, it's a concept. You use the class to make objects or execute methods and define attributes. Yes it did take me 4 days to understand that. 4 DAYS. And now that I have learned about the concept of ruby I can write code with purpouse. 

We also discussed data structure. Creating a data structure is kind like brainstorming the overall purpose and factors that your programs will need. It really helps connect the dots. It's kind of fun because you can doodle too. 

I will leave you with a quote from Hillary today. Solution before elegance.
