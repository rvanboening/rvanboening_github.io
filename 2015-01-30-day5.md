title:  "Day 5 and the weekend"
---

What is something you've learned so far that you could probably teach (i.e. explain to a reasonable degree of completion) to an interested but unexperienced friend?
I know what a class is. A class is like a factory of methods and attributes. It makes an object. If I was telling someone not interested in it I would describe it like a car factory. You have to build a factory to make a car. You make the car by using the methods and welding on the attrubutes. 

What is something you think others in the class understand much better than you. Be very, very specific. Even if you're feeling insecure and want to say, "Pretty much everything". Pick something specific.
I feel like my classmates understand terminal and everything better than I do. In terminal I never know if I am in git or when and why I have to exit. Sometimes I just exit and then my terminal says process completed. Then I have to restart my terminal. They can also make methods work from the termial which I spent all weekend trying to figure out. I liked repl.it better.
 

Describe one or two highlights from this week that have nothing to do with coding.
I really liked getting to know everyone a little better. Finding out unique qualities about different people always makes me happy. I feel closer and more understanding of who they are where they come from.
Also, It is very refreshing to have a professor that believes in teaching and understanding over agenda and grades.
