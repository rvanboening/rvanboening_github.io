title:  "Day 2"
---

Well, last night was rough. I had no idea what I was doing and google only goes so far. There for today I am staying later in class so I can have those around me. However, thats not working great right now either. 

I have become better using the command line and terminal however I'm still not a programmer. haha. I mean what can you expect for day 2. 

What I learned today. That there are lots of ways to do everything. Like make methods. Lets talk about this magical window Sumeet introduces to me. So, there is an intire box of objects on the outside of the window. An object is something and you can usually figure see it by using a @ sign. But on the other side of the window is a set of methods. A method is def method.. end. I mean thats the jist of it. But objects only are active with methods. So you have to have a method to access any of the objects. thats where the magic comes in. The window. I'm not really sure what the window is. I think its just the idea of a set of limitations. But it could also be a class. IDK. 

I mean there is a huge elephant in the room. 

My name is Rachel and will become a code developer.

Peace and love
