title:  "Day 2"
---

Well, last night was rough. I had no idea what I was doing and google only goes so far. Today I am staying later in class so I can have some help around me.

I have become better using the command line and terminal however I'm still not a programmer. haha. I mean what can you expect for day 2. 

What I learned today. That there are lots of ways to do everything. Like make methods. Let's talk about this magical window Sumeet introduced to me. So, there is an intire box of objects on the outside of the window. An object is something and you can usually know it because of the @ sign. On other side of the window is a set of methods. A method is def method.. end. I mean thats the jist of it. But objects only are active with methods. You have to have a method to access any of the objects. Thats where the magic window comes in. The window. I'm not really sure what the window is. I think its just the idea of a set of limitations. But it could also be a class. IDK. 

I mean there is a huge elephant in the room. Litteraly 

My name is Rachel and will become a code developer.
