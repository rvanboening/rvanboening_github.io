A Gem is a set of methods that you can use if you are relative or connected to the Gem.

Today was a good day. I’m feeling more comfortable in terminal.  

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
