Wow, what a day. I took a lot of notes. So, I'm going to type those up before bed - I already can't wait. But really, I learned alot, maybe I should type it up in an array. day1 = ["How to use my termianl and command line", 
"Yoga twice a week",
"The lifestyle of a programmer", 
"Only use my Terminal to prompt my computer - the faster the better", 
"Lots of promps", 
"How to save things using git" 
"Working Directory, Stage, and Commit" 
" ! - this is a bang opperator", 
" => - this is a rocket or a HASHROCKET", 
"A peramiter is a variable that is defined by an argument" 
"Heck, you can make your own methods." 
"Setters and Getters are not volleyball players, they are methods within objects, within classes."] 

Ok, that is one large array, I think I'm done.
