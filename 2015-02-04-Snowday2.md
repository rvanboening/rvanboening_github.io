title:  "Snow Day 2"

Today we were introcduced to SQlite3, which is a database program. 
There has yet to be a day where my mind is not blown. 
We also talked about Gems and API's. A Gem is a ruby spacific set of instructions one can download into a program. And an API is a data service. A Wrapper is a clean set of code to incorperate an API or GEM into your code. 

I am much more comfortable with ruby now than I was a week ago. I'm still no expert however I can gernally get things working.

This class has tested my patients everyday and I have found that when I stay relaxed and calm coding goes much better. 

As of right now, I can create a table in SQlite3, but I can't save it or access it through ruby.
